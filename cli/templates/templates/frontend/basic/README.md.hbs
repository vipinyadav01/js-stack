# Frontend Starter (Basic)

This project was generated with the JS Stack generator.

A minimal frontend starter page is included. You can:

- Replace it with your chosen framework (React, Vue, Next.js, etc.)
- Keep it as a placeholder landing page

Next steps:

1. Create your frontend app in `apps/web` or `web/`
2. Remove or replace `index.html` when your app is ready
3. Run your dev server and iterate
